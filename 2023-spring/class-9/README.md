# Understanding Decision Analysis
## Decisions
- A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that an involve an irrevocable allocation of resources.
- Decisions are hard because of uncertainty
- Purpose of Decision Analysis is to act with clarity, not certainty
### Decision Makking Systems
- Deliberative - reasoned, cool
- Affective - emotional, hot
### Number of Decisions vs. Analysis Effort

- Inverse relationship between the number of times a decision is made and the amount of analysis.
- Action without thought vs Thought before action
### Process vs Outcome

- The outcome of a decision is not idiciative of the quality of the process used to arrived at the decision
## Decision Practice
### Decision Scenario
- Instructor will flip a coin and the one person will guess whither it is heads or tails. If correct they will win $20
- The right to be the guesser is up for bid.
- Winning student won with $19 and successfuly guessed correctly. Student valued the gambling experience.
- Many students discuounted their bid due to being unsure about the fairness of the coin or a desire to have possitive expected value.
## Decision Modeling
- Money is most often the best measure of value because it is familiar, fungible, and divisible.
- Adjustments for risk attitude
- Decision Nodes - represented as a square
- Alternatives - represented as a line out of a Decision Node
- Discrete Uncertainty Node - represented as a circle
- Prospects - a line out of a Discrete Uncertainty Node
- Value - The ammount of money/value of an alternatives/prospects
## In Class Exercise
### Required Reading
1. [Foundations of Decision Analysis by Ron Howard et. al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4082150)
### Question
1. Consider the winemakerâ€™s problem from homework part 2. Model this scenario as a decision problem on the white board. What are the uncertainties? How complicated does the problem get?
	- Decision 
		- Harvest 
			- Uncertainty 
				- Machinery does or doesn't break
				- Quality of the grapes / sugar content
		- No Harvest
			- Uncertainty
				- Possibility of a storm
				- No Storm
					- Possibility of developing 'Nobel Rot'
				- Machinery does or doesn't break
				- Quality of the grapes / sugar content
2.From the required reading article, how is the section that discusses the informational phase relevant to the problem modeled above?
	- Highlights the importance of gathering relevant information to estimate the probabilities associated with each uncertainty, which is crucial for making an informed decision.
	- Gives an overview of the factors affecting the decision uncertainty and indicates factors to be considered
	- Economic value of gathering more information
	- Measuring economic sensitivity and indicates what sort of additional information could be economically gathered
	- Trade off between marginal benefits in in improved prediction quality vs cost of getting gain e.g. more models, more sensors
	- There is cost to gathering information that would help determine the value of each variable
	- Experimentation would gather data to help determine the values of a variable
	- Identify problem (the uncertainty of storms affecting the winemaking process)
	- Determine the objectives (minimizing losses due to storm)
	- Collect relevant information (weather patterns and previous storm occurrences)
