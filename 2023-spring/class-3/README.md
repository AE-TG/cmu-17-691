# Class Notes
#### Previous Class Review: 
- Data Projects ~ primary focus is data 
- ML Products vs. Research 
    - 3/4 focus on data in ML Products to 1/4 models/algorithms 
    - Research heavily focused on models/algorithms

### Data Strategy
- guiding document drafted by leaders
- outlines vision and goal
- selection of data projects should be inline with the overarching data strrategy  

>collect data a priori -> unique and relevent data will make products more beneficial

### Data Project Workflow - CRISP-DM

### Problem Definition (Business Question, Business Understanding, etc.)
- goal of data project is to reduce the uncertainty of decisions
- important to understand the value provided by reduced uncertainty

#### User Discovery:
*primary goal should be to find out if people will actually use the product*   
methods:  
- interviews, focus groups, surveys, MVP with feedback, etc.  
>Note: gold standard is MVP with feedback  

### Machine Learning Projects  
Basic Components: Data Engineering, Data Science, Software Engineering

Helps organize thoughts and ensure the project makes sense 

### Challenges with ML Projects  
<table>
    <tr>
        <td> - Poor Problem scoping </td>
        <td> - Access to reliable data and data labeling </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> - Lack of architecture design to support scale </td>
        <td> - Unaligned value proposition </td>
    <tr>
