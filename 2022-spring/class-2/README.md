### Standard Definitions

- Academic ML - A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
- Applied ML - Using automated learning algorithm to deliver valuable insights.
- Artificial Intelligence - The field of study concerned teaching computers to perform tasks formerly performed by humans.
- Deep Learning - A subset of machine learning that applies large scale neural network models to large datasets

### Categories of ML

- Unsupervised - Finding insights without a label
- Supervised - The application learns through historical records and labels.
- Reinforcement - Learning through feedback loops

### Requirements of ML Product Architecture

- Reliability - The system needs to be reliable so that it can be leveraged by other users.
- Scalability - The system should be scalable enough so as to cater to the quantity of the user.
- Maintainability - The system should be maintained and monitored to account for data or model drifts.
- Adaptability - The system should be adaptable without breaking the code.

### ML Product Design

- Critical or Complementary - Is the product critical or complementary to a problem?
- Private or Public - Is the ML model for private usage or Public usage (open-source)?
- Proactive vs Reactive - Does the ML automatically step in or does it just provide suggestions?
- Visible or Invisible
- Static or Dynamic - How often do we retrain the model?

### Good ML Product

- Provide value
- Keeps on improving

## Paper Summaries

### Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures by Leo Breiman

The paper briefly discusses two types of modeling techniques:

- Data Modeling
- Algorithmic Modeling

Discussing the difference below

| Data Modeling | Algorithmic Modeling |
| --- | --- |
| Process begins with assumptions | Process begins with data |
| Prioritises inference | Prioritises performance |
| Find the best model | Find the best algorithm |

### Software 2.0 by Andrej Karpathy

The article is written by Andrej Karpathy which discusses the contrast between Software 1.0 and Software 2.0 and how the development on Machine Learning is leading to a fundamental shift in how we develop software.

- The ‚Äúclassical stack‚Äù of¬†**Software 1.0** ¬†is what we‚Äôre all familiar with ‚Äî it is written in languages such as Python, C++, etc. It consists of explicit instructions to the computer written by a programmer. By writing each line of code, the programmer identifies a specific point in program space with some desirable behavior.
- In contrast,¬†**Software 2.0,** ¬†is written in much more abstract, human unfriendly language, such as the weights of a neural network. No human is involved in writing this code because there are a lot of weights (typical networks might have millions), and coding directly in weights is kind of hard.

In the short term, Software 2.0 will become increasingly prevalent in any domain where repeated evaluation is possible and cheap, and where the algorithm itself is difficult to design explicitly. There are many exciting opportunities to consider the entire software development ecosystem and how it can be adapted to this new programming paradigm. And in the long run, this paradigm is bright because it is increasingly clear that when we develop advanced algorithms, it will certainly be written in Software 2.0.

### Three Principles for Designing ML-Powered Products by Mark Kizelshteyn and Mat Budelman

This article explores three main principles of machine learning principles at Spotify that helps provide users with the most personalized music and enrich their experience. 

- First, a good model should be able to spot the frictions itself and remove them. Specifically at Spotify, Discovering week is a product that does this by eliminating the time users spend searching for new music that suits their tastes. Discovering week can automatically learn from users existing playlists and recommend similar music to users.
- The second thing is to find the most appropriate questions for your desired answers. Noticing that a one-fit algorithm can simply ignore so many important details, engineers should start paying more attention to the problems they ask in their algorithm.
- The last thing is to always manually review the product experience before going into machine learning analysis.
